<center><em>Lawyer Ali Alavi answers legal questions about real estate amid COVID-19.</em></center>

&nbsp;

I have a special treat for you today; I’m joined by the excellent real estate lawyer Ali Alavi who will answer some questions about the legal side of real estate as it relates to the coronavirus. People are experiencing a lot of unease right now, but you don’t need to worry when it comes to real estate. One of the main questions Ali receives from sellers right now is whether a transaction will actually close. The chief question from buyers these days: what happens with their transaction if they get laid off or furloughed? People are also curious as to how we follow social distancing guidelines with everything that has to be done in a real estate transaction. To hear the answers to these questions and more, watch the short video above.&nbsp;
