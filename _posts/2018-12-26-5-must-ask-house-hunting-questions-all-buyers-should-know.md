During their search for the perfect property, homebuyers will no doubt have a number of questions come to mind. Today I’d like to share a few of the questions I most commonly hear. 

**1. “What’s the best place to live?”** Buyers ask me this all the time, yet the answer isn’t as clear as they might think. The best place to live will vary from person to person, depending on your individual wants and needs. This is exactly why I like to meet with buyers I work with before they begin their search—so we can narrow down their specific criteria. <br><br>**2. “What will my commute look like?”** Truthfully, not all buyers think to ask this question, yet it is very important to consider, nonetheless. If a property you’re considering is an hour away from your workplace, for example, you’ll need to consider whether this will be an issue moving forward. Any commute longer than 30 minutes will likely have a significant impact on your quality of life.

**3. “How much are the utilities?”** This is a question I highly encourage buyers to ask if they have a strong interest in a certain home. After all, the cost to purchase the home isn’t the only financial consideration buyers must keep in mind as they proceed. It will also be important for them to think about the expenses associated with actually living in the home. Of course, looking at bills from the home’s current owner will only give you a rough idea of what utility costs might look like. <br><br>**4. “What do condo or homeowners association (HOA) fees include?”** If you’re moving into a condominium or an HOA, you’ll need to understand what the associated fees go toward. <br><br>**5. “How old are the major home features?”** If items like the roof, air conditioning unit, or hot water heater are old or in disrepair, this could amount to a significant expense down the line. Before making a purchase, buyers should always ask about the age and condition of a home’s “big-ticket” items. You should never feel embarrassed or hesitant to ask important questions like these during your home search. <br><br>If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
