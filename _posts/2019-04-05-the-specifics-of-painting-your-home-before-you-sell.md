Today we’ll look at one area of home improvement that home sellers typically ask me about prior to listing their home: **painting your home.**&nbsp;

**My answer is almost always “yes” when I’m presented with the question of whether to paint.** It’s very inexpensive, and it’s worth the effort to make the house feel refreshed, cleaner, and newer.&nbsp;

Understandably, it can be a hassle for some. Sellers that wish to put their home on the market quickly or who have kids and/or pets might feel pressed for time or simply decide that painting is not within practicality. If it’s a feasible option, though, it’s a fantastic way to earn more bang for your buck.&nbsp;

At the outset, **you’ll need to decide on the color you’ll go with, which should be centered around the elements of your home.** For example, if natural wood is a predominant feature of your home, the color we use will be different than what we’d use for a home with, say, a lot of granite or gray highlights.

I’m often asked what the “hot” color is at the present time, and **what seems to be taking the market by storm of late are bright shades of white, namely Chantilly Lace, which give the home a modern, chic look.** Another that I’ve come to rely on is Pale Oak—a &nbsp;neutral beige that meshes well with wood and draws out a warm feeling. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Although grays remain popular, it’s important to remember that they’re not all the same: Something like a Stonington Gray has hints of blue in it, so you’d want to determine whether the blue harmonizes with your home or not, and sunlight will make the answer shine through!&nbsp;

My personal favorite in the way of grays is Balboa Mist, due to it being a subtle, neutral shade. Those who lean toward darker colors, however, can’t go wrong with Revere Pewter.&nbsp;

**You may be tempted to paint every room a different color, but a word to the wise: Go with a single color throughout your home.** An important distinction for you to remember as a seller is that you’re not painting to decorate, you’re painting to stage your home. A single neutral color will give the greatest number of buyers the best impression. &nbsp;&nbsp;

And as a final word, **I’ve found Benjamin Moore historical colors to be the most viable in our Boston market** with the older architecture; it’s available in most area hardware stores. &nbsp;
