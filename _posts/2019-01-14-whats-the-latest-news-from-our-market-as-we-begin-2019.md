What’s happening in our market now that the holidays are gone and 2019 has officially begun? 

At the end of last year, our market started to shift into what I call the “new market.” In the “old market,” there was a lot of energy and a lot of multiple-offer situations happening, but **in the “new market,” inventory is slowly rising and we’re starting to see price reductions.** Now, buyers are pulling back and taking their time buying homes.

This doesn’t mean the market is crashing—it just means we’re entering more of a normal market. Interest rates are also slowly rising, but no one is predicting that will have a significant impact on the market. People still need places to live, and from a historical perspective, rates are still very low. 

Essentially, what we’re really talking about here is an economic slowdown and nothing more. **This means it’s still a good time to buy or sell a home. **

If you have any more questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help you.<br>
