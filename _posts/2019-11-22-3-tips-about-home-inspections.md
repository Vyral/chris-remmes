The home inspection process is a very high-stakes part of a real estate transaction both for buyers and sellers. If you’re a seller, you’ll have the inspector going through your home, examining things, and asking you lots of questions. **Here are three things that sellers can do before a home inspection to keep you organized and to ensure the process goes smoothly:**

**1\. Hire a professional to service your HVAC system.** It always looks good to a home inspector if they see you’ve recently had it looked over. Even though buyers might not ask to have that done, it’s good to be one step ahead anyway.

**2\. Clear access to important places.** The inspector will need to take a look at things like your furnace, electrical box, and the roof, so be sure to have those areas clear and accessible.

**3\. Provide relevant information to the inspector and buyer.** If you have receipts for any work you’ve had done recently, those are useful to show to both the inspector and buyer.

**1\. Show up and pay attention.** The inspection is one of your closing costs and can range between $500 and $1,500, depending on the kind of house you’re buying. You’re paying a lot of money for this process, so be sure to pay close attention to the information the inspector passes on to you.

**2\. Take notes.** There will be a lot of information you’ll want to remember, and the inspector will sometimes tell you something verbally that may not end up being written on the report. I recommend that you bring a pen and paper to the inspection and take careful notes.

**3\. Show up with questions.** As your real estate agent, I won’t be as qualified to answer your questions about the systems of the home, so be sure to think of some great questions to ask the inspector, who is an expert.
