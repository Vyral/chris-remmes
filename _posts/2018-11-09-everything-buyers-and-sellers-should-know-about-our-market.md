Between recent political happenings, rising interest rates, and the decrease in buyer activity, many in our market are experiencing a little anxiety as a result of these developments.&nbsp;

**Despite the fact that our market is slowing down, it hasn’t come to a halt.** It’s still a good time to buy or sell. With that in mind, many are wondering who currently has the advantage.&nbsp;

Actually, though inventory is creeping up slowly, it is still nowhere near the levels we’ve seen in the past; we are still in a seller’s market. However, conditions will vary between price points. The market is still fairly active between the $600,000 and $800,000 price point, for example, while activity has slowed in higher-end markets.

Another major concern among those in our market is the direction of interest rates. With prices and interest rates both on the rise, **the key to getting a great deal on your next home is to partner with an experienced, local mortgage professional.&nbsp;**

The bottom line is this: If you’re a buyer, it’s always a good time to make a home purchase—and right now is no exception. And if you’re a seller, you can still earn a good price for your listing, even though it may happen as quickly as in the recent past. People buy and sell real estate 12 months a year.&nbsp;
