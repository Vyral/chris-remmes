My 2020 recap: It started out crazy, but we’re in a better place now.

As we wrap up 2020, I want to take a look back at this chaotic year.&nbsp;

In January and February, we didn’t even know what the coronavirus was, and by March the world was frightened and filled with uncertainty. The economy retracted for a couple of months, and no one knew what the future would hold. By May, things started to slowly turn around, and thankfully we realized things would be okay.&nbsp;

**Now here we are in December, and we’re busy again.** People’s housing needs have changed—many need more indoor and outdoor space. I just listed a six-family property in Dorchester, a one-bedroom home here in Charlestown, and got a three-bedroom house under agreement in east Boston, so things are moving. We’re being safe and doing everything we can to meet people’s needs in this changing world.

As we look forward to 2021, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but we still have to be smart and follow all health protocols. **I hope you have a joyful and healthy holiday season** and a fortunate 2021.&nbsp;

If you ever have any questions about real estate, call or email me. Over the next couple of weeks if you don’t want to discuss real estate and just want to say hello, feel free to reach out as well. Happy holidays\!
