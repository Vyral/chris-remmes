By all accounts, we believe the real estate market is very strong. The economy is improving, interest rates are low, and inventory is very low. This bodes well for sellers, but if you’re thinking of selling your home soon, you need to think about how things will differ in 2021.

2020 taught us that buyers are out there, but they’re looking online. They’re looking at fewer houses and following more video tours. You must keep this in mind as you get your home ready for sale. Since we're still in the middle of winter, there are several tips that you can easily follow up on to prep your home for the spring market:&nbsp;

**1\. Declutter.** Since it’s 2021, I’d say you need to uber-declutter because everything needs to look good on video. It takes time to declutter because there are always more things in your closets, drawers, etc., than you think there will be.

**2\. Paint with light colors.** You want things to look bright in your home as the sun shines inward. As I said, many more people will be using online video to look at your house instead of visiting it in person, so it has to look good in those videos. You have to capture buyers’ imaginations and emotions.&nbsp;

**3\. Do minor repairs.** Additionally, you should upgrade your fixtures. If there are any fixtures in the house you want to take with you, switch them out so it doesn’t become an issue down the road.&nbsp;

Another important thing to remember is to keep following all CDC protocols. Vaccinations are underway, but we’re still in the middle of a pandemic. In-person visitors will be wearing masks, but you should still have your countertops and surfaces clean and have hand sanitizer available so that everyone feels safe and comfortable.&nbsp;

If you have questions about today’s topic or need help preparing your home for the market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
