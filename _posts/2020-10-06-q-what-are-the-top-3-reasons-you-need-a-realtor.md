*Here are the three reasons why you need a Realtor in your corner.*

Today I’ll answer an important question for buyers and sellers: Why should you hire a Realtor? There are three reasons, in particular:&nbsp;

**1\. You need someone who knows the process.** Whether you’re buying or selling, you need someone on your side who knows how to avoid any bumps in the road and make the process as smooth as possible. If you’re a seller, you’ll need someone who can help you get your house ready for the market so you can sell for top dollar. If you’re a buyer, you’ll need someone who can get you into the best properties, locate off-market listings, and connect you to excellent mortgage brokers.

**2\. You need someone with market knowledge.** Ever since the pandemic hit, we’ve seen shifts in the market like never before—we even saw another shift these past couple of weeks. This means you need someone with their finger on the pulse of the market; a Realtor with no experience isn’t much help.

**3\. You need someone with negotiating skills.** If you’re a seller, you need someone who can price your property correctly, create a buzz of activity among buyers, and generate multiple offers. If you’re a buyer, you need someone who knows how to write a winning offer, because you’ll likely have to compete against other offers for the home you want.&nbsp;
