{% include youtube.html %}Today I wanted to take some time to wish you all a happy and safe Thanksgiving. Now that the Thanksgiving holiday season has begun, I hope you’re all as excited as I am. It’s my favorite holiday to celebrate, especially here in New Zealand. I want to thank everyone who has placed their trust in me and my team to get their real estate needs met—it’s been a tricky market. If you or any of your loved ones need anything or if you have any questions, no matter how silly, feel free to reach out to us. We’ll be here through the holidays. To hear my full Thanksgiving message, watch this short video.
