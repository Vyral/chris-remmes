Recently, the Remmes Group was featured in an article in “Top Agent Magazine” that discussed what makes the Remmes Group such a wonderful team of real estate professionals. **Here are just a couple of choice excerpts:**

“*Built on a solid foundation of honesty, integrity and a commitment to excellence in customer service, Boston’s The Remmes Group has earned \[its\] stellar reputation. Helmed by broker Chris Remmes, they are one of those rare real estate teams that consistently go above and beyond the call of duty to take care of their clients, ensuring the kind of loyalty that sees their rate of return and referred business hovering around a staggering eighty percent*.”
