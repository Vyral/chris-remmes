**As fall is now underway, the market remains busy, and this season is an opportune time to command a high price selling your home. &nbsp;**

I know what’s happening in Boston, specifically pertaining to home values, that will directly affect you.

**So, I'll be posting two monthly video messages on this blog to keep you updated.&nbsp;**

They will be valuable and useful in helping you stay on top of what’s happening in the community.

You can also search all homes for sale on the MLS on my website at chrisremmes.com.&nbsp;

Let me know if you have any questions or if you’re thinking of buying or selling a home in Boston soon.

Check back because content will be coming soon!

I’m excited to keep you updated on what’s going on with Boston, and more specifically, Boston real estate.
