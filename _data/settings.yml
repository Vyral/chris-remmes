    As a longtime resident of Boston, Chris Remmes is recognized as one of the
    leading residential brokers in the Boston market. Chris brings a
    professional approach as well as a service-oriented philosophy to his real
    estate practice. He has built an excellent reputation and developed a loyal
    customer following of past clients and referrals by serving them well.


    Chris joined Hammond Residential after ten years in the real estate industry
    to provide his clients with the latest and most comprehensive marketing and
    cutting-edge technology available today. Hammond Residential was acquired by
    Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, which is renowned for its innovation
    and ingenuity and for leading the real estate industry with integrity and
    professionalism.


    As a graduate of Massachusetts Maritime Academy, Chris previously worked as
    a Deck Officer for Exxon where he sailed around the world and satisfied his
    passion for travel and adventure.&nbsp; At Exxon, his intuition and skills
    with technology established him as a leader.&nbsp; He was selected for
    special assignments, which developed technology solutions for the maritime
    industry.


    However, his love of Boston brought him back to his hometown. His career in
    real estate started in 1998 in the mortgage lending business. During this
    time, he obtained his MBA from Boston University.&nbsp; His knowledge of the
    real estate market and mortgage experience gives him a wide breadth of
    knowledge, which has helped him establish himself as a top broker in the
    Boston market. Chris works out of the Coldwell Banker offices in the South
    End and Charlestown; he is knowledgeable in all the downtown neighborhoods
    of Boston.
